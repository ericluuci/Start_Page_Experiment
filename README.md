# Start_Page_Experiment

The prototype was written in python 2.7 and requires pygame to run.

This prototype was used to write a start page for games. It consists of a start menu which has my name, title of the game, and press a button to start the game. After the start menu will be the actual game but as this was an experiment, the game consists of a few platforms and a background. The game is not interactable in any form.
